I am trained in VR physics warfare and I'm the top virtual grip sniper in the entirety of BONEWORKS. You are nothing to me but another crablet. I will wipe you the fuck out with the precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this dimensional plane, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to us over the BONEWORKS Fan Discord? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting the MythOS Police, and your positional coordinates are being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little you call your opinion. You're fucking dead, kid. I can relocate anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you with over seven hundred different physics objects, and that just in the first stage. Not only am I extensively trained in VR fists combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of MythOS and I will use it to its full extend to unleash a fucking cryptid to wipe your miserable opinion off the face of this reality, you little shit. If only you could have know what justified anger your little 'clever' opinion was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking wireframe tongue. But you couldn't, you didn't, and now you're paying the price, you goddamn melon-eater. I will sever your connection to the real world and you'll remain a VR Junkie forever.

The latter incorporates cutting edge technology in to the virtual reality space and is much more focused on gameplay and creating believable interactions in a consistent world, HL:A is more so for those who have been waiting more of the story of Half-Life. The main showcase of this is floating hands being in HL:A and BONEWORKS having a full body. It's a bold move to help push VR further and innovate in the space, paving the way for future games to increase immersion. HL:A is Valve's main way to sell the Index, and yes, it may have a much more rich and grounded story than BONEWORKS but on a technical level the chance that the raw interactions will even come close is very slim.
